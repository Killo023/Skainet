## 🔧 Customization Options

### To Adjust Header Logo Size:
Edit `src/components/Header.jsx` line ~53:

```jsx
// Smaller
className="h-10 w-auto object-contain"

// Current
className="h-12 w-auto object-contain"

// Larger
className="h-16 w-auto object-contain"
```

### To Adjust Footer Logo Size:
Edit `src/components/Footer.jsx` line ~19:

```jsx
// Smaller
className="h-12 w-auto object-contain bg-white p-2 rounded-lg"

// Current
className="h-14 w-auto object-contain bg-white p-2 rounded-lg"

// Larger
className="h-16 w-auto object-contain bg-white p-2 rounded-lg"
```

### To Remove White Background in Footer:
```jsx
// Remove: bg-white p-2
className="h-14 w-auto object-contain rounded-lg"
```

---

## ✨ Technical Implementation

### File Path
```
Logo location: public/Media/Logo.jpg
Referenced as:  /Media/Logo.jpg
```

**Why this path works:**
- Files in `public/` folder are served at the root URL
- React automatically resolves `/Media/Logo.jpg`
- No import statement needed
- Works in both development and production builds

### Image Optimization
The logo is loaded as a static asset, meaning:
- ✅ Fast loading (no bundler processing)
- ✅ Cached by browser
- ✅ Same file for all instances
- ✅ Works perfectly with React

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Add Favicon
Create a favicon from your logo:

**public/favicon.ico**
```html
<!-- Add to public/index.html -->
<link rel="icon" href="/Media/Logo.jpg" />
```

### 2. Add to Manifest
For PWA support:

**public/manifest.json**
```json
{
  "name": "Skainet Cleaning Services",
  "short_name": "Skainet",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/Media/Logo.jpg",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Create Multiple Sizes
For better performance, create optimized versions:
- Logo-small.jpg (200px)
- Logo-medium.jpg (500px)
- Logo-large.jpg (1000px)

Then use:
```jsx
<img
  src="/Media/Logo-medium.jpg"
  srcSet="/Media/Logo-small.jpg 200w, /Media/Logo-medium.jpg 500w"
  alt="Skainet Cleaning Services"
/>
```
